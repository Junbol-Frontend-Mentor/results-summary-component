## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass(SCSS)
- BEM (Block.Element.Modifier)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- GIT/GitHub
- PowerShell (CLI)

### What I learned

- creating all the logic in Javascript to do the creation of the data frames dynamically.
- Using forEach again to iterate on the buttons
- Using javascript to add the logic to make classes and elements to the DOM. for just a small project it was interested how I needed a bit of complex logic to resolve this because the combination of DOM , CSS classes manipulation and fetching a json data

```


```

### Continued development

I would like to continue studying responsive SCSS specially with Grid + Flexbox and CSS animation, transitions and FX like parallax.
